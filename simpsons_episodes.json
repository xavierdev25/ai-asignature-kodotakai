The ball is much too big for the family to eat, and it gets dirty (as ants, birds, cats and the Flanders children get stuck to it). Finally Marge insists Homer get rid of it. He takes it to city the dump, and is confronted by a large, grizzly bear, from which he cowers. The bear eventually wanders off without attacking, apparently bored by Homer's crying."
